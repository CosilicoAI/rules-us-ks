(b) Any ruling, agreement or contract, whether written or oral, express or implied, between a retailer and this state's executive branch, or any other state agency or department, stating, agreeing or ruling that the retailer is not required to collect sales and use tax in this state despite the presence of a warehouse, distribution center or fulfillment center in the state that is owned or operated by the retailer or an affiliated person of the retailer shall be null and void, unless it is specifically approved by a majority vote of each of the chambers of the Kansas legislature.
