              <p>79-3304. License fees and bond; disqualifications for issuance or renewal of license. (a) The license fee for each biennium or portion thereof shall be as follows: (1) For retail dealer's license, $25 for each dealer establishment. (2) For retailer's license on railroad or sleeping cars, $50. Only one retail license need be obtained by each railroad or sleeping car company to permit the sale of cigarettes on any or all of its cars within the state. (3) For show, carnival or catering license, $50 for each concession. (4) For resident retail dealer's temporary license for a place of business of a temporary nature, $2 for each seven days or portion thereof. (5) For wholesale dealer's license, $50 for each dealer establishment. No wholesale dealer's license shall be issued until the person applying therefor has filed with the director a bond payable to the state of Kansas in such an amount as shall be fixed by the director, but in no event less than $1,000, with a corporate surety authorized to do business in the state of Kansas, and approved by the director. If a wholesale dealer is unable to secure a corporate surety bond, the director may issue a license to such wholesale dealer, upon the wholesale dealer furnishing a personal bond meeting the approval of the director. Such bond shall be conditioned on the wholesale dealer's compliance with all the provisions of this act during the license period. (6) For vending machine distributor's license, $50. (7) For manufacturer's salesperson license, $20 for each salesperson. The manufacturer's salesperson shall, with respect to each sale made to a retail dealer, make and deliver to the retail dealer a true invoice wherein such salesperson shall insert the name of the wholesale dealer from whom such salesperson secured such cigarettes, together with such salesperson's own name and the name of the retail dealer purchasing the cigarettes. (8) For vending machine operator's license, no fee. (9) For vending machine permit, $25 for each permit. (b) An application for any license required under the provisions of this act may be refused to: (1) A person who is not of good character and reputation in the community in which such person resides; or (2) a person who has been convicted of a felony or of any crime involving moral turpitude or of the violation of any law of any state or the United States pertaining to cigarettes or tobacco products and who has not completed the sentence, parole, probation or assignment to a community correctional services program imposed for any such conviction within two years immediately preceding the date of making application for any of such licenses. (c) The director may refuse to issue or renew a license to any person who: (1) Has been convicted on or after January 1, 2013, of a felony under the laws of this state or any other state or the United States; (2) is not current in the payment of any tax or fine under this act; (3) has had a cigarette license revoked in this state or any other state; (4) is not at least 21 years of age; (5) intends to carry on the business as an agent of another; (6) at the time of application for renewal of any license issued under this act, would not be eligible for the license upon first application; (7) does not own the premises for which a license is sought, or does not, at the time of the application, have a written lease; (8) has been convicted of a crime involving any tax under this act; (9) is a corporation in which any officer, manager or director thereof, or any stockholder owning in the aggregate more than 5% of the common or preferred stock of such corporation, has been an officer, manager or director or stockholder owning in the aggregate more than 5% of the common or preferred stock, of a corporation that: (A) Has had a license revoked under this act; or (B) has been convicted of a crime involving any tax under this act; or (10) is a limited liability company in which any officer, manager or director thereof, or any member owning in the aggregate more than 5% of the limited liability company, has been an officer, manager or director or stockholder owning in the aggregate more than 5% of the common or preferred stock, of a corporation that: (A) Has had a license revoked under this act; or (B) has been convicted of a crime involving any tax under this act.</p>
