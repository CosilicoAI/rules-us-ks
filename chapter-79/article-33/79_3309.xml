(c) If a person continues to engage in activities requiring a license under this act after having notice or knowledge of the suspension or revocation of the person's license or licenses or after becoming more than 10 days delinquent in filing a bond payable to the state of Kansas as required by the director, payment of any fine, tax, penalty or interest imposed pursuant to this act, the state shall be entitled, in any proceedings brought for such purposes, to have an order and judgment restraining and enjoining such unlawful sale and no bond shall be required for the issuance of any such restraining order or injunction.</p>
