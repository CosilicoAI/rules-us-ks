Disposition of moneys; compensating tax refund fund; credit to state highway fund; credit to city bond finance fund; intermodal facility district, definition, disposition, requirements and procedures for certain compensating tax revenue on utility sales. (a) All revenue collected or received by the director under the provisions of this act shall be remitted to the state treasurer in accordance with the provisions of K.S.A. 75-4215, and amendments thereto. Upon receipt of each such remittance, the state treasurer shall deposit the entire amount in the state treasury, less amounts set apart as provided in subsection (b) and amounts credited as provided in subsection (c), (d) and (e), to the credit of the state general fund. (b)窶ア revolving fund, designated as &quot;compensating tax refund fund&quot; not to exceed $10,000 shall be set apart and maintained by the director from compensating tax collections and estimated tax collections and held by the state treasurer for prompt payment of all compensating tax refunds. Such fund shall be in such amount, within the limit set by this section, as the director shall determine is necessary to meet current refunding requirements under this act. (c) (1) On January 1, 2023, the state treasurer shall credit 17% of the revenue collected and received from the tax imposed by K.S.A. 79-3703, and amendments thereto, at the rates provided in K.S.A. 79-3703, and amendments thereto, and K.S.A. 2024 Supp. 79-3603d, and amendments thereto, and deposited as provided by subsection (a), exclusive of amounts credited pursuant to subsection (d), in the state highway fund.

The provisions of this subsection shall expire when the total of all amounts credited hereunder and under K.S.A. 79-3620(d), and amendments thereto, is sufficient to retire the special obligation bonds issued for the purpose of financing all or a portion of the costs of such redevelopment project. This subsection shall not apply to a project designated as a special bond project as defined in K.S.A. 12-1770a(z), and amendments thereto.

Such revenue may be transferred by the secretary of transportation to the rail service improvement fund pursuant to law. The provisions of this subsection shall take effect upon certification by the secretary of transportation that a notice to proceed has been received for the construction of the improvements within the intermodal facility district, but not later than December 31, 2010, and shall expire when the secretary of revenue determines that the total of all amounts credited hereunder and pursuant to K.S.A. 79-3620(e), and amendments thereto, is equal to $53,300,000, but not later than December 31, 2045. Thereafter, all revenues shall be collected and distributed in accordance with applicable law. For all tax reporting periods during which the provisions of this subsection are in effect, none of the exemptions contained in K.S.A. 79-3601 et seq., and amendments thereto, shall apply to the sale or furnishing of any gas, water, electricity and heat for use or consumption within the intermodal facility district. As used in this subsection, &quot;intermodal facility district&quot; shall consist of an intermodal transportation area as defined by K.S.A. 12-1770a(oo), and amendments thereto, located in Johnson county within the polygonal-shaped area having Waverly Road as the eastern boundary, 191 st Street as the southern boundary, Four Corners Road as the western boundary, and Highway 56 as the northern boundary, and the polygonal-shaped area having Poplar Road as the eastern boundary, 183 rd Street as the southern boundary, Waverly Road as the western boundary, and the BNSF mainline track as the northern boundary, that includes capital investment in an amount exceeding $150 million for the construction of an intermodal facility to handle the transfer, storage and distribution of freight through railway and trucking operations.</p>
