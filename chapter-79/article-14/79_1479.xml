              <p>79-1479. Appraisal of property; submission of progress reports; duties and authorities of director of property valuation and state board of tax appeals relating to compliance with reappraisal guidelines and timetables; complaint procedure; review of valuations after completion of reappraisal; compliance plans, approval and enforcement. (a) On or before January 15, 1992, and quarterly thereafter, the county or district appraiser shall submit to the director of property valuation a progress report indicating actions taken during the preceding quarter calendar year to implement the appraisal of property in the county or district. Whenever the director of property valuation shall determine that any county has failed, neglected or refused to properly provide for the appraisal of property or the updating of the appraisals on an annual basis in substantial compliance with the provisions of law and the guidelines and timetables prescribed by the director, the director shall file with the state board of tax appeals a complaint stating the facts upon which the director has made the determination of noncompliance as provided by K.S.A. 79-1413a, and amendments thereto. If, as a result of such proceeding, the state board of tax appeals finds that the county is not in substantial compliance with the provisions of law and the guidelines and timetables of the director of property valuation providing for the appraisal of all property in the county or the updating of the appraisals on an annual basis, it shall order the immediate assumption of the duties of the office of county appraiser by the director of the division of property valuation until such time as the director of property valuation determines that the county is in substantial compliance with the provisions of law. Upon service of any such order on the board of county commissioners, the appraiser shall immediately deliver to the director of property valuation, or the director's designee, all books, records and papers pertaining to the appraiser's office. Any county for which the director of the division of property valuation is ordered by the state board of tax appeals to assume the responsibility and duties of the office of county appraiser shall reimburse the state for the actual costs incurred by the director of the division of property valuation in the assumption and carrying out of such responsibility and duties, including any contracting costs in the event it is necessary for the director of property valuation to contract with private appraisal firms to carry out such responsibilities and duties. (b) On or before June 1 of each year, the director of property valuation shall review the appraisal of property in each county or district to determine if property within the county or district is being appraised or valued in accordance with the requirements of law. If the director determines the property in any county or district is not being appraised in accordance with the requirements of law, the director of property valuation shall notify the county or district appraiser and the board of county commissioners of any county or counties affected that the county has 30 days within which to submit to the director a plan for bringing the appraisal of property within the county into compliance. If a plan is submitted and approved by the director the county or district shall proceed to implement the plan as submitted. The director shall continue to monitor the program to insure that the plan is implemented as submitted. If no plan is submitted or if the director does not approve the plan, the director shall petition the state board of tax appeals for a review of the plan or, if no plan is submitted, for authority for the division of property valuation to assume control of the appraisal program of the county and to proceed to bring the same into compliance with the requirements of law. If the state board of tax appeals approves the plan, the county or district appraiser shall proceed to implement the plan as submitted. If no plan has been submitted or the plan submitted is not approved, the board shall fix a time within which the county may submit a plan or an amended plan for approval. If no plan is submitted and approved within the time prescribed by the board, the board shall order the division of property valuation to assume control of the appraisal program of the county. The director of property valuation shall certify the amount of the cost incurred by the division in bringing the program in compliance to the state board of tax appeals. The board shall order the county commissioners to reimburse the state for such costs. (c) The state board of tax appeals shall within 60 days after the publication of the Kansas assessment/sales ratio study review such publication to determine county compliance with K.S.A. 79-1439, and amendments thereto. If in the determination of the board one or more counties are not in substantial compliance and the director of property valuation has not acted under subsection (b), the board shall order the director of property valuation to take such corrective action as is necessary or to show cause for noncompliance.</p>
