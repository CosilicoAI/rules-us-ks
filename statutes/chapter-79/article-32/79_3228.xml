              <p>79-3228. Penalties and interest. (a) For all taxable years ending prior to January 1, 2002, if any taxpayer, without intent to evade the tax imposed by this act, shall fail to file a return or pay the tax, if one is due, at the time required by or under the provisions of this act, but shall voluntarily file a correct return of income or pay the tax due within six months thereafter, there shall be added to the tax an additional amount equal to 10% of the unpaid balance of tax due plus interest at the rate prescribed by subsection (a) of K.S.A. 79-2968, and amendments thereto, from the date the tax was due until paid. (b) For all taxable years ending prior to January 1, 2002, if any taxpayer fails voluntarily to file a return or pay the tax, if one is due, within six months after the time required by or under the provisions of this act, there shall be added to the tax an additional amount equal to 25% of the unpaid balance of tax due plus interest at the rate prescribed by subsection (a) of K.S.A. 79-2968, and amendments thereto, from the date the tax was due until paid. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event an assessment is issued following a field audit for any period for which a return was filed by the taxpayer and all of the tax was paid pursuant to such return, a penalty shall be imposed for the period included in the assessment in the amount of 10% of the unpaid balance of tax due shown in the notice of assessment. If after review of a return for any period included in the assessment, the secretary or secretary's designee determines that the underpayment of tax was due to the failure of the taxpayer to make a reasonable attempt to comply with the provisions of this act, such penalty shall be imposed for the period included in the assessment in the amount of 25% of the unpaid balance of tax due. (c) For all taxable years ending after December 31, 2001, if any taxpayer fails to file a return or pay the tax if one is due, at the time required by or under the provisions of this act, there shall be added to the tax an additional amount equal to 1% of the unpaid balance of the tax due for each month or fraction thereof during which such failure continues, not exceeding 24% in the aggregate, plus interest at the rate prescribed by subsection (a) of K.S.A. 79-2968, and amendments thereto, from the date the tax was due until paid. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event an assessment is issued following a field audit for any period for which a return was filed by the taxpayer and all of the tax was paid pursuant to such return, a penalty shall be imposed for the period included in the assessment in an amount of 1% per month not exceeding 10% of the unpaid balance of tax due shown in the notice of assessment. If after review of a return for any period included in the assessment, the secretary or secretary's designee determines that the underpayment of tax was due to the failure of the taxpayer to make a reasonable attempt to comply with the provisions of this act, such penalty shall be imposed for the period included in the assessment in the amount of 25% of the unpaid balance of tax due. (d) For all taxable years ending after December 31, 2013, if any taxpayer who has failed to file a return, and after notice from the director refuses or neglects within 20 days to file a proper return, the director shall determine the income of such taxpayer according to the best available information and assess the tax together with a penalty of 50% of the unpaid balance of tax due plus interest at the rate prescribed by subsection (a) of K.S.A. 79-2968, and amendments thereto, from the date the tax was originally due to the date of payment. If, at any time, a taxpayer filed a return and paid in full the tax due as stated on the return, at the time required by or under the provisions of this act and subsequently is adjusted by the director, and a notice of liability is sent to the taxpayer, no penalty shall be assessed under the provisions of this subsection with respect to any underpayment of income tax liability due to the adjustment if any such tax is paid within 30 days of such notice of liability. If any such tax is not paid within 30 days of original notice, the penalty provided under the provisions of this subsection shall apply. (e) Any person, who with fraudulent intent, fails to pay any tax or to make, render or sign any return, or to supply any information, within the time required by or under the provisions of this act, shall be assessed a penalty equal to the amount of the unpaid balance of tax due plus interest at the rate prescribed by subsection (a) of K.S.A. 79-2968, and amendments thereto, from the date the tax was originally due to the date of payment. Such person shall also be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall, upon conviction, be fined not more than $1,000 or be imprisoned in the county jail not less than 30 days nor more than one year, or both such fine and imprisonment. (f) Any person who willfully signs a fraudulent return shall be guilty of a felony, and upon conviction thereof shall be punished by imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years. The term &quot;person&quot; as used in this section includes any agent of the taxpayer, and officer or employee of a corporation or a member or employee of a partnership, who as such officer, employee or member is under a duty to perform the act in respect of which the violation occurs. (g) (1) Whenever the secretary or the secretary's designee determines that the failure of the taxpayer to comply with the provisions of subsections (a), (b), (c) and (d) of this section was due to reasonable causes, the secretary or the secretary's designee may waive or reduce any of the penalties and may reduce the interest rate to the underpayment rate prescribed and determined for the applicable period under section 6621 of the federal internal revenue code as in effect on January 1, 1994, upon making a record of the reasons therefor. (2) No penalty shall be assessed hereunder with respect to any underpayment of income tax liability reported on any amended return filed by any taxpayer who at the time of filing pays such underpayment and whose return is not being examined at the time of filing. (3) No penalty assessed hereunder shall be collected if the taxpayer has had the tax abated on appeal, and any penalty collected upon such tax shall be refunded. (h) In case of a nonresident or any officer or employee of a corporation, the failure to do any act required by or under the provisions of this act shall be deemed an act committed in part at the office of the director. (i) In the case of a nonresident individual, partnership or corporation, the failure to do any act required by or under the provision of this act shall prohibit such nonresident from being awarded any contract for construction, reconstruction or maintenance or for the sale of materials and supplies to the state of Kansas or any political subdivision thereof until such time as such nonresident has fully complied with this act.</p>
