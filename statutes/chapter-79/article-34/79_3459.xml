Upon receipt of a claim for refund by the director if the director shall find that the same is complete and as required by law, and is satisfied that such refund is due, the director, within 20 days after receiving the same, shall certify to the director of accounts and reports the name and address of the claimant and the amount of the refund due, and within 10 days thereafter the director of accounts and reports shall draw a warrant so certified on the treasurer of state and against the motor-vehicle fuel or special fuel tax refund fund to the claimant of such refund, except that if the director, director of accounts and reports and state treasurer shall agree that payments of refunds could be made more expeditiously if the warrants on the state treasurer were written in the office of the director, then the director may draw such warrants and the signatures of the director of accounts and reports and state treasurer required thereon shall be placed thereon by an employee or agent appointed by the director of accounts and reports and state treasurer but whose compensation shall be paid by the director of taxation from the revenue administration fee fund.
