              <p>79-3373. Distributor's license. No person shall engage in the business of selling or dealing in tobacco products as a distributor in this state without first having received a license from the director. Every application for such license shall be made on a form prescribed by the director and shall state the name and address of the applicant; if the applicant is a firm, partnership or association, the name and address of each of its members; if the applicant is a corporation, the name and address of each of its officers; the address of its principal place of business; the place where the business to be licensed is to be conducted; and such other information as the director may require for the purpose of the administration of this act. A person outside this state who ships or transports tobacco products to retailers in this state, to be sold by those retailers, may make application for license as a distributor, be granted such a license by the director and thereafter be subject to all the provisions of this act and entitled to act as a licensed distributor if the person files with the application proof that the person has appointed the secretary of state as the person's agent for service of process relating to any matter or issue arising under this act.</p>
