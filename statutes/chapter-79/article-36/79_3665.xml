              <p>79-3665. Interstate streamlined sales tax project; participation by the department of revenue; legislative participation. (a) The department of revenue is authorized to become a signatory to an agreement with one or more states for the purpose of providing a multi-state, voluntary, streamlined system for sales and use tax collection and administration to simplify and modernize sales and use tax administration in order to substantially reduce the burden of tax compliance for all sellers and for all types of commerce, at such time as the legislature takes further action to bring the state's laws in compliance with the requirements of the agreement. The department of revenue is further authorized to participate in the streamlined sales tax project, identify all changes in this state's sales and use tax laws and rules and regulations that would be required in order to comply with such agreement, take such other actions reasonably required to prepare this state for entry into such agreement. (b) The secretary of revenue, or the secretary's designee, is authorized to represent this state before other states that are participating in the streamlined sales tax project or that are signatories to such agreement. In addition, the president and the minority leader of the senate and the speaker and the minority leader of the house of representatives may each appoint a person who is also authorized to so represent this state. All such appointees attending meetings shall be paid compensation, subsistence allowances, mileage and other expenses as provided in K.S.A. 75-3223, and amendments thereto.</p>
