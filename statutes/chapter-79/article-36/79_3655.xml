              <p>79-3655. Same; department of revenue discussions with other states; topics included. The department of revenue shall enter into discussions with states regarding development of a multi-state, voluntary, streamlined system for sales and use tax collection and administration. These discussions shall focus on a system that would have the capability to determine whether the transaction is taxable or tax exempt, the appropriate tax rate applied to the transaction, and the total tax due on the transaction, and shall provide a method of collecting and remitting sales and use taxes to the state. Such system may provide compensation for the costs of collecting and remitting sales and use taxes. Discussions between the department and other states may include, but are not limited to: (a) The development of a &quot;joint request for information&quot; from potential public and private parties governing the specifications for such system; (b) the mechanism for compensating parties for the development and operation of such system; (c) establishment of minimum statutory simplification measures necessary for state participation in such system; and (d) measures to preserve confidentiality of taxpayer information and privacy rights of consumers. Following these discussions, the department may proceed to issue a joint request for information.</p>
