(b) Savings and loan associations shall be allowed as a deduction from net income, as defined in subsection (a), a reserve established for the sole purpose of meeting or absorbing losses, in the amount of 5% of such net income determined without benefit of such deduction, but no further deduction shall be allowed for losses when actually sustained and charged against such reserve, unless such reserve shall have been fully absorbed thereby; or, in the alternative, a reasonable addition to a reserve for losses based on past experience, under such rules and regulations as the secretary of revenue may prescribe. (c) For all taxable years commencing after December 31, 2022, national banking associations, state banks, trust companies and savings and loan associations shall be allowed as a deduction from net income, as defined in subsection (a), the net interest income received from qualified agricultural real estate loans attributed to Kansas and the net interest income received from single family residence loans attributed to Kansas to the extent such interest is included in the Kansas taxable income of a corporation.
