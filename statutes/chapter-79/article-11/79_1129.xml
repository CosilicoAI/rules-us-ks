              <p>79-1129. Same; procedures and methodology in determining allocable and apportionable income. (a) Except as otherwise specifically provided, a financial institution whose business activity is taxable both within and without this state shall allocate and apportion its net income as provided in this act. All items of nonbusiness income, income which is not includable in the apportionable income tax base, shall be allocated pursuant to the provisions of K.S.A. 79-3274 through 79-3278 and amendments thereto. A financial institution organized under the laws of a foreign country, the commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or a territory or possession of the United States whose effectively connected income, as defined under the federal internal revenue code, is taxable both within this state and within another state, other than the state in which it is organized, shall allocate and apportion its net income as provided in this act and its apportionment factors shall include the part of its property, payroll and receipts that is related to its apportionable income. (b) All business income, income which is includable in the apportionable income tax base, shall be apportioned to this state by multiplying such income by the apportionment percentage. The apportionment percentage is determined by adding the taxpayer's receipts factor, as described in K.S.A. 79-1130, property factor, as described in K.S.A. 79-1131, and payroll factor, as described in K.S.A. 79-1132, together and dividing the sum by three. If one of the factors is missing, the two remaining factors are added and the sum is divided by two. If two of the factors are missing, the remaining factor is the apportionment percentage. A factor is missing if both its numerator and denominator are zero, but it is not missing merely because its numerator is zero. (c) Each factor shall be computed according to the method of accounting, cash or accrual basis, used by the taxpayer for the taxable year. (d) If the allocation and apportionment provisions of this act do not fairly represent the extent of the taxpayer's business activity in this state, the taxpayer may petition for or the secretary of revenue may require, in respect to all or any part of the taxpayer's business activity, if reasonable: (1) Separate accounting; (2) the exclusion of any one or more of the factors; (3) the inclusion of one or more additional factors which will fairly represent the taxpayer's business activity in this state; or (4) the employment of any other method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer's income. (e) In the event a combined report is utilized to determine the Kansas income attributable to a unitary group of financial institutions, the financial institutions in the combined group shall include only those institutions which have a branch or office in Kansas.</p>
